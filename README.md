## ðŸ‘¾ Extracting assets
- You can extract the `.xpk` files that contain game assets using meth0d's [XPK Tool](https://github.com/The-Meth0d/XPKTool-SantaClausInTrouble)
- You can now edit the assets or just explore them
- Pack the edited assets to a new `.xpk` file with XPK Tool and share it with others

You can install other's asset mods by simply replacing the original `.xpk` file with the mod one. Make sure to backup the original one first!

**If you want to extract SCITHD assets, you can use Jeysym's [PAK Tool](https://github.com/jeysym/scit-hd-pak-tool).**
